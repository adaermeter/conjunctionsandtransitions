      <h2>What are Conjunctions?</h2>
      <p>Conjunctions are words that connect clauses, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, or phrases together. They act as bridges between ideas in a sentence.</p>
      
      <div class="usage-tip">
        <h4>💡 Pro Tip:</h4>
        <p>Conjunctions make your writing flow smoothly and show relationships between ideas. Without them, sentences would be short and choppy.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="conjunction-type">
        <h3>1. Coordinating Conjunctions (FANBOYS)</h3>
        <p>Used to connect words or clauses of equal importance. Remember the acronym FANBOYS:</p>
        
        <div class="fanboys">
          <div class="fanboy-card">For</div>
          <div class="fanboy-card">And</div>
          <div class="fanboy-card">Nor</div>
          <div class="fanboy-card">But</div>
          <div class="fanboy-card">Or</div>
          <div class="fanboy-card">Yet</div>
          <div class="fanboy-card">So</div>
        </div>
        
        <div class="examples">
          <p><strong>Usage Notes:</strong></p>
          <p>• <strong>But/Yet</strong> - show contrast</p>
          <p>• <strong>And/Or</strong> - connect similar structures</p>
          <p>• <strong>For</strong> - shows reason (more formal)</p>
          <p>• <strong>Nor</strong> - used with "neither", requires inverted structure</p>
          <p>• <strong>So</strong> - shows result</p>
          
          <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
          <p>• I wanted to go out, <strong>but</strong> it was raining.</p>
          <p>• Do you want coffee <strong>or</strong> tea?</p>
          <p>• She doesn't like me, <strong>nor</strong> does she love you.</p>
          <p>• It was cold, <strong>yet</strong> we went swimming.</p>
          <p>• She studied hard, <strong>so</strong> she passed the exam.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="conjunction-type">
        <h3>2. Subordinating Conjunctions</h3>
        <p>Connect a main clause with a subordinate (dependent) clause.</p>
        <div class="examples">
          <p><strong>Common Subordinating Conjunctions:</strong></p>
          <p>• although, because, since, while, when, if, unless, until</p>
          
          <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
          <p>• <strong>Although</strong> it was difficult, she finished the task.</p>
          <p>• <strong>Because</strong> he was tired, he went to bed early.</p>
          <p>• <strong>While</strong> I was cooking, she was setting the table.</p>
          <p>• <strong>If</strong> you study hard, you will pass the exam.</p>
